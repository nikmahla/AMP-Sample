            What is Web Design?

        <div>

            <p class="myFont">Web design is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content
                intended for the Internet.
                Modern web design goes beyond how things look (aesthetics) to include how things work (functionality).

            <p class="myFont">
                Web design elements
                When designing a website, it’s imperative to consider both the look and the functionality of the site.
                Integrating these elements into the design will help maximize the performance of the site, regardless of
                how
                performance is measured. For example, did you know that, because of search engine

        <div>
            <h2 class="fonth2">Adaptive websites</h2>
            <p class="myFont">
                Adaptive web design uses two or more versions of a website that are customized for different screen
                sizes.
                Adaptive websites can be split in two main categories based upon how the site detects what “version”
                needs
                to be displayed.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2 class="fonth2">
                Adapts based on browser width
            </h2>
            <p class="myFont">
                Instead of using the “user-agent”, the website uses media-queries and breakpoints to switch between
                versions. So instead of having a desktop, tablet, and mobile versions, you’d have 1080px, 768px, and
                480px
                width versions. On top of offering more flexibility when designing, this approach offers a more
                “responsive”
                look when changing the size of your browser on a large screen.

                Responsive websites
            </h2>
            <p class="myFont">

                Responsive websites use a combination of flexible grids (based on percentages) with breakpoints (using
                media
                queries) to create a custom look at every screen size. Unlike adaptive sites that adapt only when they
                hit a
                breakpoint, responsive websites are constantly changing according to the screen size.

            <p class="myFont">
                Requires extensive design and testing to ensure quality (when starting from scratch)Without accessing

                custom designs can be challenging.
            <p>
                Note: Adaptive websites can contain responsive elements. For example, image galleries can be built to be
                fully
                responsive while the rest of the site is adaptive.

                User interactions
            </h2>
            <p class="myFont">
                Your site visitors have multiple ways of interacting with your site depending on their device
                (scrolling,
                clicking, typing). The best designs always simplify these interactions giving the user the impression
                they
                are in complete control. Here are just a few examples:
